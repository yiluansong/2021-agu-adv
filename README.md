2021 AGU Advances paper

This repository contains data and code used for the manuscript:
Song, Y., Zajic, C. J., Hwang, T., Hakkenberg, C. R., & Zhu, K. (2021) Phenological shift lagging behind climate change in human-dominated landscapes. AGU Advances.

In this study, we show 1) rapidly shifting vegetation phenology has not kept pace with the recent climate change, and 2) climate-phenology mismatch is more pronounced in human-dominated landscapes with increasing human population density.

Data (raw or pre-processed) are provided in ./data/. Our analyses can be replicated with ./code/. Figures from the analyses are stored in ./figures/.

Please note:
* There are large map files in the repo that requires large file storage (LFS). Please run "git lfs install" in the terminal before cloning the repo.
